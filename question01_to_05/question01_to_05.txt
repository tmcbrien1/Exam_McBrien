1. Should 'ecological modeling of populations of organisms' be considered a bioinformatics research area or not? Briefly explain your answer.

While specific cases may or may not be appropriate for bioinformatics, ecological modeling of populations should overall be considered a bioinformatics research area because it could potentially involve large amounts of metagenomic data. For example, using bioinformatics techniques to look at gene flow and speciation events over time could be a powerful technique. Similarly, looking for homologous genes could help genotype different organisms within a population.

2. True/False. All molecular sequence data available at NCBI are peer-reviewed and tehrefore are more reliable than sequences obtained from other data bank services.

False. Some other databases, such as RefSeq, are manually curated and very reliable.

3. A database search returns a match with an E-value of 3.4e-178. How do you interpret this result?

The e-value is an estimate of the amount of times you would expect a result at least this extreme to be observed by chance. The closer to 0, the less likely. So an E-value of 3.4e-178 is extremely close to zero, meaning the resulting match is very likely to be significant.

4. What are two ways that we increase the copy number of our target DNA before sequencing it?

You can increase copy number either by cloning it in a bacterial vector or by PCR amplification.

5. How many genomes do eukaryotes generally have per cell? Prokaryotes?

Eukaryotes: two to three per cell. Nuclear genome, mitochondrial genome, chloroplast genome (plants/algae only).
Prokaryotes: just one, the nuclear genome. They can have plasmids, which complicates things a bit, but in general just one.
