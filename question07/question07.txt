Now, find a nucleotide sequence from the same gene from Jatropha curcas — what is its accession number?

Accession number: NM_001308783.1

1. What type of blast is the most appropriate in this case?

Since we have a protein sequence but we want to find a nucleotide sequence, a tblastn would be the most appropriate search.

2. When you do the blast to the nr database at NCBI, how many hits do you return?

124 hits returned.

3. Using the taxonomy report, indicate from how many species you found homologs.

38 species with homologs.

4. Download fasta files of the top 6 hits – pick sequences that are of similar length to your sequence from curcas, and have e-values that suggest significant homology. List the accession numbers from these top 6 hits and their e-values from your blast (3 pts).
